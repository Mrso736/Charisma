___Become Comfortable with Discomfort:___  
You wouldn’t expect to stay in shape without regularly going to the gym and eating right. Charisma operates on the same principle: stay charismatic by regularly using all the things you’ve learned.

Get comfortable with discomfort by breaking social customs:
* Hold eye contact longer 
* Experiment with personal space
* Strike up conversations with strangers.

___Make it Part of Your Identity:___  
Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

The ultimate form of intrinsic motivation is when a habit becomes part of your identity. It’s one thing to say I'm the type of person who wants this. It’s something very different to say I’m the type of person who does this. The more pride you have in a particular aspect of your identity, the more motivated you will be to maintain the habit associated with it.

The goal is not to socialize, the goal is to become someone who is very social.

When your behavior and your identity are fully aligned, you are no longer pursuing behavior change. You are simply acting like the type of person you already believe yourself to be.

There is internal pressure to maintain your self-image and behave in a way that is consistent with your beliefs.
