# CHAPTER 1: Charismatic Mindset

_“It never ceases to amaze me: we all love ourselves more than other people, but care more about their opinion than our own.” - Marcus Aurelius_
___

# 1: Confidence

Knowing your internal world starts with one key insight upon which all charisma is built: your mind can’t tell fact from fiction, imagining oneself performing an activity activates parts of the brain that are used in actually performing the activity.


&nbsp;


___Visualization:___  
This visualization is a great tool to increase the amount of power you want to convey.

1. Close your eyes and relax.
1. Remember a past experience when you felt complete confidence.
1. Hear the sounds in the room: the murmurs of approval, the swell of applause.
1. See people’s smiles and expressions of warmth and admiration.
1. Feel your feet on the ground and the congratulatory handshakes.
1. Experience your feelings, the warm glow of confidence rising within you.

For some people this is all they need, however, others are more sensitive to auditory cues, so here’s an alternative to visualization: select key phrases to mentally focus on.

- “Confidence is not ‘They will like me’. Confidence is ‘I’ll be fine if they don’t’”
- “A week from now, or a year from now, will any of this matter?”
- “This, too, shall pass. Yes, it will.”
- “Look for little miracles unfolding right now.”
- “Love the confusion.”
- “What if you could trust the Universe, even with this?”

You can also add real sensory input to your visualizations. For example, play music while you verbalize or subvocalize, create a personalized playlist of music that reflects the internal state you desire. Movie themes may also be helpful.

Add movement to your visualizations. Because physiology affects psychology, creating certain movements or postures can bring up specific emotions in your mind.

___Reverse Visualization:___  
Emotions and body language are so closely connected that by adopting a particular posture or facial expression, you can actually create the corresponding feelings in your mind. Just as with visualization, where the right image will create corresponding emotions and body language, displaying confident body language will actually make you feel more confident; these feelings will in turn affect your body language, which will adapt to display even more confident signals, creating a positive feedback loop that continually reinforces your confidence.

    For confidence and assertiveness, try adopting a military general's posture: stand wide, puff up your chest, broaden your shoulders, 
    stand straight and confidently put your arms behind your back. Feel the effect of this posture internally.

    For a boost in both energy and warmth, stand up, stretch your hands as high up as possible, inhale as much as you can.
    Imagine your rib cage expanding, doubling in size. Make the biggest smile you can and look upward, hold for a second, and then relax everything.

# 2: Warmth

People give great credence to the intentions they perceive you to have. So if, for instance, you can get yourself into a mental state of goodwill, this would show in your facial expressions and body language and register with people on a deep emotional level. People perceiving this would want to like you, want to see your behaviors and actions in the most positive way. Think of goodwill as your charisma safety net: as long as you can get into a state of goodwill, you will have the absolute best chances of getting your charisma right.


&nbsp;


___Gratitude:___  
Appearing desperate can harm one's chances in various situations, from job interviews to dates. Gratitude is a great antidote to all of these negative emotions because it comes from thinking of things you already have, from material items to meaningful relationships. Even in challenging circumstances, reflecting on the things you are grateful for can shift your body language and demeanor to a more positive state, improve your mental performance, and boost your sense of security, confidence and warmth.

One way to invoke a sense of gratitude is to focus on little things that are physically present. For instance, focus on little delights: the sun streaming through the window; blue skies; the temperature; or the existence, availability, and wonders of ketchup.

Another good gratitude-enhancing tool is to view your life through a third-person lens, writing a narrative about yourself cast in a positive light.


&nbsp;


___Goodwill and Compassion:___  
Goodwill improves how you feel as it floods your system with oxytocin and serotonin. It lessens our need to make the interaction succeed. When our only aim is to broadcast goodwill, it takes the pressure off. We’re no longer striving, struggling, pushing for things to go in a certain direction. And since we’re less concerned about how the interaction goes, we can both feel and project more charismatic confidence.

To cultivate goodwill towards someone, try to identify at least three things to appreciate or approve of, even if these are as small as “their shoes are shining” or “they were on time.” When you start searching for positive elements, your mindset shifts, which impacts your body language and overall demeanor.

In any interaction, imagine the person you’re speaking to, and all those around you, as having invisible angel wings. If even for a split second you can see someone as a fundamentally good being, this will soften and warm your emotional reaction toward them, changing your entire body language. Focusing on others' well-being is a crucial element of charisma, as it demonstrates that you genuinely care about them.


&nbsp;


___Self-Compassion:___  
Self-compassion is how much warmth we can have for ourselves, especially when we’re going through a difficult experience. Its what helps us forgive ourselves when we’ve fallen short; it’s what prevents internal criticism from taking over and playing across our face

Individuals who score high on self-compassion scales demonstrate greater emotional resilience to daily difficulties and fewer negative reactions to difficult situations.

1. Sit comfortably, close your eyes, and take two or three deep breaths. As you inhale, imagine drawing in masses of clean air toward the top of your head; then let it whoosh through you from head to toe as you exhale, washing all concerns away.
1. Think of any occasion in your life when you performed a good deed, however great or small. Just one good action—one moment of truth, generosity, or courage. Focus on that memory for a moment.
1. Now think of one being, whether present or past, mythical or actual, who could have great affection for you. This could be a person, a pet, or even a stuffed animal.
1. this being in your mind. Imagine their warmth, their kindness and compassion. See it in their eyes and face. Feel their warmth radiating toward you, enveloping you.
1. See yourself through their eyes with warmth, kindness, and compassion. 
1. Feel them giving you complete forgiveness for everything your inner critic says is wrong. You are completely and absolutely forgiven. You have a clean slate. Feel them giving you wholehearted acceptance. You are accepted as you are, right now, at this stage of growth, imperfections and all.

# 3: Overcoming Anxiety

Any internal discomfort, either physical or mental, can have a negative impact on your performance and how others perceive you. Our brains are wired to be uncomfortable with uncertainty. The minute our brain detects uncertainty, it sends out an error signal that often leads to anxiety and ultimately harms our charisma. It's hard to be fully present or emanate warmth when you're feeling anxious. Additionally, anxiety can lower your confidence, which can show up in your body language.

Another way to skillfully handle any difficult experience is the three-step process: destigmatize discomfort, neutralize negativity, and rewrite reality.


&nbsp;


___1. Destigmatize Discomfort:___  
To destigmatize, remind yourself that this feeling is a natural part of the human experience and that it simply is a legacy of our survival instincts. It helps to think of others who have experienced similar feelings, particularly those who you admire and relate to.

Recognize that you're not alone. With almost 8 billion people on this planet, I can guarantee that many are going through the exact same thing as you are at this very moment. Instead of seeing it as one big emotion felt by one person, see it like you are part of a huge community of humans experiencing this one feeling at this very moment.

Shame can be powerful as it affects our sense of acceptance as humans. Our brains still interpret social needs as a survival necessity because, for our ancestors, rejection by the tribe meant death.


&nbsp;


___2. Neutralize Negativity:___  
One of the main reasons we’re so affected by our negative thoughts is that we think our mind has an accurate grasp on reality, and that its conclusions are valid. Unfortunately, this is not always the case. In fact, our minds are prone to serious distortions, and this is particularly true when it comes to negative thinking. because the elements that our danger-focused brain deems important are usually the most negative ones. This tendency is called the negativity bias.

Trying to suppress a self-critical thought only makes it more central to your thinking, it’s a far better strategy to simply aim to neutralize it:

- Don’t assume your thoughts are accurate. Assume you’re missing a lot of elements, many of which could be positive.
- Assign a label to your negative experience: self-criticism, anger, anxiety, etc.
- Depersonalize the experience. Rather than saying “I’m feeling ashamed,” try to imagine that you’re a scientist observing a phenomenon: “How interesting, there are self-critical thoughts arising.”
- Imagine yourself from a third person perspective, zoom out into the immensely big  universe, and slowly zoom back in. See your little self, electrical impulses whizzing across your brain. One little being experiencing something at this moment in time.
-  your mental chatter as coming from a radio; see if you can turn down the volume, or even just put the radio to the side and let it chatter away.


&nbsp;


___3. Rewrite Reality:___  
In most situations, we don’t know for certain what motivates a person’s actions, so we might as well choose the explanation that is most helpful to us and create a version of events that puts us in the right mental state for charisma. 

One charismatic entrepreneur said: “I decide to interpret everything favorably toward myself. It’s not just that I’m optimistic, I’m actually conveniently deluded.” This approach works because the brain has a tendency to accept imagination as reality.

When faced with a challenging situation that might impair your charisma, instead of ignoring or suppressing your internal struggles, ask yourself what mental state would be most useful in this situation? And rewrite reality to put you there. It's knowingly administering the placebo effect on yourself.


&nbsp;


___Other ways:___  
Focusing on the small physical sensations of discomfort serves a dual purpose: it gives your mind something concrete to focus on other than its growing conviction that this situation is unbearable. It also has the advantage of bringing you instantly into full presence. In fact, this technique, called delving into sensations, can help you access charismatic presence even during highly uncomfortable situations.

A fast way to feel better when you’re feeling anxious is to flood your system with Oxytocin. Oxytocin instantly reverses the arousal of the fight-or-flight response. Imagining a twenty-second hug is enough to send oxytocin coursing through your veins.

choose figures who represent complete self-confidence, or warmth and caring, or calm and serenity. Or you might even find some figures who embody all the elements at once. Visualize yourself going to these figures for a “pep talk” anytime you feel you need one. Thanks to the brain’s wonderful placebo response


&nbsp;


# 4: Conversational Mindset

There is one all-important law of human behavior. If we obey that law, we greatly reduce our chances of encountering trouble, and will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we break the law, we will find ourselves in endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel important.

The truth is that most people you meet feel superior to you in some way, and a sure way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance, and recognize it sincerely.


&nbsp;


___Have a sense of belonging:___  
Embrace the present moment and have a sense of belonging wherever you find yourself.  Adept to the mood and setting and show that that is where you belong at this moment in time.

Imagine the guy that is standing in the corner on his phone at the party, he doesn’t belong.
Now picture the person who knows their purpose and confidently fits into any setting.

Don't let self-consciousness or shyness hold you back. Choose to believe that you are meant to be exactly where you are, and let that belief guide your actions and interactions. Embrace your surroundings, adapt to the mood, and radiate a genuine sense of belonging.

Remember, you have the power to transform any situation into one where you feel confident, connected, and in sync with your environment.
