# What is Charisma?

Charisma is a skill that can be developed through practice, rather than an innate trait that only a few people are born with. Contrary to popular belief, you do not have to be extroverted or attractive to be charismatic.
And you don't have to change your personality.

To appear charismatic, one should aim to possess both high power and high warmth,
which can be achieved by asking oneself the power questions, "Fight or flight?" and the warmth question, "Friend or foe?"

Charismatic individuals often choose specific behaviors that make others feel a certain way, and these behaviors can be learned and perfected by anyone.
To become more charismatic, it is helpful to understand the three key elements of charisma: presence, power, and warmth.
By developing these elements, one can become more charismatic and influential in their personal and professional lives, without having to change who they are as a person.

    Presence:

  <dd>
    Being present means being aware of what's happening around you, rather than getting caught up in your own thoughts.
    If you're not fully present, people will notice, even if it's just a split-second delay in your reactions.

    Power:

  <dd>
    Power is about having the ability to affect the world around you, whether through authority,
    expertise, or social status. We often look for signs of power in someone's appearance and body language.

    Warmth:
  </dt>  
  <dd>
    Warmth is all about whether or not people will want to use whatever power they have in others' favor.
    Are they kind and caring, or do they only look out for themselves?
    We can usually tell if someone is warm through their behavior and body language.

Research has shown that warmth and power are the two main things we evaluate when we meet someone. We look for clues like body language and appearance to help us make these evaluations. Expensive clothing leads us to assume wealth, friendly body language leads us to assume good intentions, a confident posture leads us to assume the person has something to be confident about. In short, people will tend to accept whatever image you project.
