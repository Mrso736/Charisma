# CHAPTER 2: Body Language

"It's how you looked when you said it, not what you actually said
___


Language is a fairly recent invention in human evolution and is grasped first by people’s cognitive/logical minds. While nonverbal communication is deeply ingrained and affects us on an emotional level.

Unconsciously, every second our body reflects our mental and emotional state through posture, facial expressions, voice, and other components.

Charisma is mostly dependent on body language rather than words. Good body language can make you charismatic without saying a word, while bad body language can hinder even the strongest message. Simply projecting presence, power, and warmth through your body language is enough to create a charismatic impression.

# 1: Mirroring

The fundamental principle of making yourself likable is quite simple: people like those who are like them. This originates from our evolutionary past, where identification of who belonged to our tribe was crucial for survival. Today, people continue to be drawn to those who share similar characteristics, interests, and value.

To search for these similarities, we instinctively engage in a process known as 'mirroring,' that involves observing and imitating their body language and gestures. Mirroring communicates, nonverbally, 'Look at me; I'm just like you. I feel the same way and share the same attitudes.' This mirroring creates a sense of ease and comfort in others.

It is important to note that mirroring should be done subtly and naturally, without appearing forced or exaggerated. It is not about imitating or mimicking the other person's every move, but rather subtly matching their nonverbal cues. This can include facial expressions, gestures, and even tone of voice.

___Warmth With Mirroring:___  
Mirroring is one of the most important body-language lessons you can learn because it's a clear way in which others tell us that they agree with us or like us. It is also a way for us to tell others that we like them, by simply mirroring their body language.

When you consciously mirror someone’s body language, you activate deep instincts of trust and liking. Making it an effective tool for encouraging people to open up. A former political journalist noted how mirroring helped him during interviews. “People get share-oriented,” He said. Studies from around the world have also shown that mirroring can get them to pick up your dropped items, buy your products, or give you a better deal. Mirroring even makes you more attractive to others.


&nbsp;


___Synchronous behavior:___  
Studies into synchronous body-language behavior show that people who feel similar emotions, or are on the same wavelength, will also begin to match each other's body language and expressions, contributing to a sense of rapport and connection between individuals.

This is one of the reasons why playing background music during a date is so effective. Music has the ability to evoke emotions and create a shared mood or atmosphere. When couples listen to music together, it can synchronize their movements, like tapping their feet or nodding their heads in time with the rhythm. This synchronization gives the feeling of being connected and in tune with each other, strengthening the overall experience and giving a sense of togetherness. 

When a person says “the vibes are right” or that they “feel right” around another person, they are unknowingly referring to this unconscious synchronization of behaviors and emotions.


&nbsp;


___Mirroring facial expressions:___  
Men and women’s brains are programmed differently to express facial emotions. When someone mirrors another person's expressions, it can create a sense of empathy and make the speaker feel understood. 

Women on average use six main facial expressions in a ten-second listening period  to both reflect and reciprocate the speaker's emotions, Her face will effectively mirror the emotional cues expressed by the speaker.

Men, on the other hand, generally hold expressionless faces, because of the evolutionary need to hide emotions from possible attackers and to appear to be in control of their emotions. When a man actively mirrors facial expressions while listening, he will be described as more caring, intelligent, interesting, and attractive.


&nbsp;


___Mirroring Tone:___  
Intonation, voice inflection, speed of speaking, and even accents also synchronize during mirroring to further establish mutual attitudes and build rapport. This is known as pacing, matching the speed of the other person's speech. Studies have shown that when someone speaks faster than they do, that others describe feeling “pressured”. Therefore, it is generally recommended to match or slightly adjust your speaking speed to match that of the person you are talking with.


&nbsp;


___Using mirroring:___  
In a new meeting with someone try to mirror their seating position, posture, body angle, gestures, expressions, and tone of voice. It can signal to them that you are engaged and interested in what they have to say and before long, they'll start to feel that there's something about you they like, as they’ll start to see aspects of themselves reflected in your behavior.

By mirroring positive nonverbal signals, you are essentially creating a nonverbal agreement or alignment with the other person. This can lead them to describe you as someone who is "easy to be with" because they feel a sense of familiarity and similarity.

Never mirror a person's negative signals as this can have the opposite effect and create tension or discomfort in the conversation.


&nbsp;


# 2: First Impressions

In just a few seconds, people have already judged your social and economic level, your level of education and success. Within minutes, they’ve also decided your intelligence, trustworthiness, friendliness, competence and confidence. Despite happening in an instant, these evaluations can last for years, and first impressions can be incredibly difficult to change. After making a judgment about someone, we tend to spend our time with them trying to prove ourselves correct. We filter everything we see and hear through this initial impression.

The Harvard team found that first impressions are formed by the fastest and most primitive part of the brain. This part of the brain is responsible for our primal instincts and may have played a crucial role in our ancestors' survival. In the past, we often had only a split second to determine whether shapes entering our field of vision were animate or inanimate, human or nonhuman, friend or foe. As a result, whether we’re trying to impress a new boss, or make a new friend. In high-stakes situations we react far stronger to body language than to words because our fight-or-flight response activates and a more primal part of the brain takes over. This part of the brain does not directly comprehend words or ideas. Instead, it’s immediately impacted by body language.


&nbsp;


___Confident Posture:___  
No matter how many signs of power and high status we may project through our appearance, title, etc. If our body language shows insecurity, it can kill charisma instantly. However, projecting confidence through body language can give us charisma even when we don't have any other signs of power.

Because we can’t read people’s minds, we make assumptions based on clues we observe. When someone displays confident body language, we assume they have reason to be confident. This is because people tend to accept what is projected. Any increase in the amount of confidence your body language projects will bring you major charisma rewards.

As Stanford's Gruenfeld found, assuming expansive poses (taking up more space) can cause a measurable physiological shift. In one experiment, assertiveness- and energy-promoting hormones increased by 19 percent, while anxiety hormones decreased by 25 percent. Assuming a strong and confident physical posture will make you feel more confident and more powerful. Which will further improve your body language. This creates a cycle that builds upon itself. With practice, confident body language can become second nature.


&nbsp;


___Tribes:___  
Dressing in a manner that aligns with the expectations and style of a particular social group or environment can help you blend in and make a positive impression. 

Adapting to their "tribal wear" can create a sense of familiarity and comfort, allowing youself to fit in more easily. However, If you wish to impress them, choosing clothing that is at the upper end of the range within that environment can enhance your perceived status or competence.


&nbsp;


___Eyes:___  
Our eyes are a key part of our nonverbal communication, often considered the most significant. They are the most mobile part of the entire face, making them the most expressive part of the face. 

Eye contact plays a crucial role in effective communication. It can convey empathy, thoughtfulness, wisdom, and intelligence, making it a vital aspect of charisma. You simply cannot be charismatic without it. Charismatic individuals often use eye contact to make others feel important. Anthropologist Helen Fisher explains that intense eye contact can increase heart rate and trigger the release of phenylethylamine (PEA), a hormone associated with the phenomenon of love at first sight.

Few things impair charisma more than bad eye contact and few things gain you charisma points more than improving your eye contact.


&nbsp;


___Smiling:___  
Your smile is a powerful tool that can brighten the lives of those around you. Not only does it convey goodwill, a smile makes you sound and appear warmer.

Regular smiling is important to have as a part of your body-language routine, even when you don't feel like it, because smiling directly influences other people's attitudes and how they respond to you.

Studies show that we stand farther away from people who have a grumpy expression, give them less eye contact, and avoid them when they are walking toward us.


&nbsp;


___Hand gestures:___  
Throughout history, the open palm has been associated with truth, honesty, allegiance, and submission. From an evolutionary perspective, shows the person holds no weapons, and thus is not a threat.

Charismatic people use open hand gestures, and use their body to emphasize the words they speak. 


&nbsp;


___Head Movements:___  
Nodding once to emphasize a point or show agreement is acceptable, but nodding three or four times in rapid succession is not. 

Lowering your chin a few degrees can have a positive impact in two ways. Firstly, it prevents you from appearing condescending by avoiding the impression of looking down your nose at someone when your head is tilted back. Secondly, it enhances your presence by making you look more thoughtful, attentive, and intentional, and naturally widens your eyes for added effect. You can imagine a king bowing their head to a noble emissary as a helpful visualization.


&nbsp;


___Warmth with Space:___  
not respecting people’s personal-space preferences can create high levels of discomfort, and those emotions could become associated with you. It’s worth paying attention.

To create a comfortable environment for someone, avoid seating them with their back facing an open space, particularly if others are moving around behind them. This seating arrangement can result in an increase in breathing rate, heart rate, and blood pressure. their discomfort would likely affect their perception of you.

If you want to establish warmth it is recommended to avoid confrontational seating arrangements like the ones you see in job interviews. Instead, consider sitting either next to them or at a 90-degree angle.
