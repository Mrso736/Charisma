# CHAPTER 3: Conversational Charisma

_"Talk to a man about himself and he will listen for hours" - Dale Carnegie_
___


&nbsp;


# 1: First Impressions

First impressions are extremely important as they can stay with people for years. While it is very easy to make a good impression, many people seem to have no idea what to say when meeting new people.


&nbsp;


___Spark up Conversation:___  
Let me assure you, as long as you project warmth and confidence (power) the content of what you say really doesn't matter. There are generally 2 ways to start a conversation:

You can simply comment on what is happening around you.

Another effective method to start a conversation that communicates warmth and sets up the conversation is to make an observation, there are 5 good observations you can make:

* Their hairstyle: “You have such a cool hairstyle it reminds me of….“
* Their clothing style: “Your style is very unique, it’s very …..”
* Their walk: “You have such a determined walk; it reminds me of ….”
* A unique item: “Those are some bad ass shoes, they make you look like ….”
* Matching items: “I just noticed how your …. matches the color of your ….. and your …..”

Follow this up by open-ended questions like "What's the story behind it?" The word "story" evokes a strong emotional response and sends them straight into storytelling mode.


&nbsp;


___Asking Their Name:___  
The next step is to ask for their name.

Like Dale Carnegie said, "A person's name is to them the sweetest sound in any language" their name is more interesting to them than all the other names on earth put together.

Remember that name and call it easily, and you will have paid a subtle but very effective complement.


&nbsp;


___Breaking the Ice:___  
Keeping the conversation going can be achieved by asking open-ended questions such as “What brought you here tonight?” or “Where are you from?”

Remember, it’s all about making them the center of conversation for as long as possible. “Talk to a man about himself, and he will listen for hours,” said Benjamin Disraeli. In fact, when you’re speaking, the one word that should pop up most often in your conversation is not “I” but “you”.


&nbsp;


___Assumptions:___  
Now that you’ve got them opening up, to continue the conversation, Instead of asking them things, try to make an assumption. Here are three types of assumptions you can make: 

* Where they are from: “You seem like you are from …” Or “You don’t seem like you are from ...”
* What they do for hobbies/work: “You seem like you do something creative.”
* What type of person they are: “You seem like you're a very outgoing, life-of-the-party type of person.”

They will go: “What?!? Why’s that.” Or, your guess will be right, and you’ll blow everyone’s minds, you answer by giving a legitimate reason to back up your statement. For example, “you speak in a very formal & articulate manner which reminds me of my doctor.”


&nbsp;


___Interests:___  
The royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most. Focusing on the interests of the other person and asking questions they will enjoy answering. 

Encouraging them to talk about themselves and their achievements is also a surefire way to never run out of things to say. 

In addition to always having a topic of conversation, you'll learn a lot of new knowledge about hobbies and other activities that you probably wouldn't have known otherwise. 

To better connect with people, adjust your choice of words and expressions to better match their interests:

* If they are interested in golf, use a metaphor like "hitting a hole in one." 
* If they enjoy sailing, refer to a catastrophe as a "shipwreck."
* If someone is into tech, use terms like “optimizing” and “efficiency”
* If someone is a movie fan, use film-related metaphors like "cut to the chase"


&nbsp;


___Bounce-back technique:___  
If they start asking about you and you want to refocus the conversation on them, use the bounce back technique. Answer the question with a fact, add a personal note, and redirect the question to them:

<dl>
 <dd>
  Them: “So where are you moving to?”
 </dd>

 <dd>
  You: “To France [fact]. I really love the scenery there [personal note]. What do you think about the scenery in France [redirect]?”
 </dd>
</dl>


&nbsp;


___Ending a Conversation:___  
The final moments of a conversation can also have lasting impact, much like first impressions. To make a graceful exit, it's helpful to offer something of value:
 
* Information: an article, book, or Web site you think might be of use to them
* A connection: someone they ought to meet whom you know and can introduce them to
* Visibility: an organization you belong to, where you could invite them to speak
* Recognition: an award you think they should be nominated for

Providing value will often create a feeling of warmth and goodwill toward you, leaving a positive impression of generosity when you exit the conversation.

According to studies conducted by MIT Media Lab, people tend to remember how it feels to speak with someone rather than the exact words or content used in the conversation. Therefore, It's important to take notice of what emotion your conversation gives off because people will associate you with whatever feelings you give them.


&nbsp;

# 2: Listening

Like Dale Carnegie once said, “You can make more friends in two months by becoming genuinely interested in other people than you can in two years by trying to get other people interested in you." People are generally not interested in others, they are interested in themselves.


&nbsp;


___Being Present:___  
Charisma is not determined by the length of your conversations but rather by your ability to be fully present in each interaction. Even in a five-minute conversation, being fully present can create a "wow" effect and make you stand out from the crowd. When you’re not fully present, your facial reactions may be delayed and your eyes can glaze over. Humans can read facial expressions in as little as seventeen milliseconds, so even the slightest delay in your reactions can be noticed.

We may think that we can fake our presence and listening. We believe that simply appearing attentive while our minds are elsewhere is enough. But we’re wrong. When we’re not fully present, people will see it. Our body language sends a clear message that other people read and react to on a subconscious level.

The next time you're in a conversation, try to regularly check whether your mind is fully engaged or whether it is wandering elsewhere, including preparing your next sentence. By focusing for just a second on your breath or the feeling in your toes, you can bring yourself back to the present moment. This quick fix will instantly show in your eyes and your face. By giving the person you're talking to just a few moments of your full presence, they will feel respected and listened to.


&nbsp;


___Become Genuinely Interested in Others:___  
People are a hundred times more interested in themselves and their wants and problems than they are in you and your problems. If you want to be a good conversationalist, be an active listener.

Try to be different by focusing on being genuinely curious about the person you're talking to as we become interested in others when they are interested in us. If you listen because you are genuinely interested, they will feel it. That kind of listening is one of the highest compliments you can pay anyone. 

If you're focused on genuinely understanding and connecting with them, it can help you forget your own worries and build confidence in a more natural way.


&nbsp;


___Make Them Feel Important:___  
There is one all-important law of human behavior. If we obey that law, we greatly reduce our chances of encountering trouble, and will bring us countless friends and constant happiness. But the very instant we break the law, we will find ourselves in endless trouble. The law is this: Always make the other person feel important.

Almost everyone considers themself important, very important. The truth is that almost all people you meet consider themselves superior to you in some way, and a fast way to their hearts is to let them realize in some subtle way that you recognize their importance, and recognize sincerely.

Remember what Emerson said: “Every man I meet is my superior in some way. In that, I learn of him.” Every single person has a story to tell, mistakes they’ve made, successes they’ve had. listen to them and learn from them.


&nbsp;


___Listening with Charisma:___  
One of the most common mistakes people make is equating listening with “letting people talk until it’s my turn.” That is not sufficient. Even if the other person is doing all the talking, you can’t let your mind wander while waiting for your turn to speak. Effective communication involves not only speaking but also actively listening and making the other person feel important. To achieve this, there are several ways to make others feel important and listened to. 

Try imagining the person you're speaking with as the star of a movie, which can make them more interesting to you and may even leave them feeling like a movie star.

Another way is to avoid interrupting them, as even well-intentioned input can trigger feelings of resentment or frustration for not having been allowed to finish their thought. Instead, let others interrupt you, keeping sentences short and frequently pausing to encourage the sharing of thoughts. 

Finally, pause before responding, which makes people feel genuinely listened to and understood. Additionally, try pausing briefly after someone speaks, letting your facial expression react first to show that you value what they just said. Only then, after about two seconds, answer. 


&nbsp;


# 3: Speaking 

Others will associate you with the way you make them feel. For most charisma, it’s critical to make others feel good about themselves. Benjamin Disraeli was skilled at making people feel intelligent and interesting, people would associate the wonderful way they felt around him with the man himself.

Charismatic people are masters at using these positive associations, whether consciously or subconsciously, you’ll often hear people rave about how “special” and “wonderful” they felt around them.


&nbsp;


___Mentions:___  
When people choose to bring up a topic or share something with others, it usually signifies that it holds some level of significance to them. Seldom do people mention something if it isn't somewhat important to them, iit often reflects a desire to express themselves, seek validation, or establish a connection.

By leaning into the topic and asking follow-up questions, you demonstrate your genuine curiosity and interest in their thoughts, and opinions, making them feel listened to.


&nbsp;


___Speaking visually:___  
Our brain's visual processing abilities are much older and more deeply ingrained than its language-processing capabilities. When you speak in words, the brain has to relate the words to concepts, then translate the concepts into images for better understanding. However, speaking directly in pictures can bypass most of this process and allow for greater impact and memorability. When you make your images and metaphors, try to make them sensory-rich: involve as many of the five senses as possible. Even in the most mundane situations, you can make your communication more engaging by using vivid language and rich sensory details. When you speak, use few words and lots of pictures, strive to make it both useful and entertaining.

Tell stories rather than facts. Make them emotional and engaging. Spark immediate attention by using a hook before you even begin telling the story:

"I almost accidentally killed Jim", then tell how it happened. Instead of saying that at the end.

As exercise you can try to record yourself while coming up with stories, to find your weaknesses and improve. Try coming up with a wide range of stories where you start with a hook and build from there.


&nbsp;


___Voice Fluctuations:___  
MIT Media Lab discovered that they could accurately predict the success of sales calls without listening to a single word, the only two measurements they needed were: the ratio of speaking to listening and the amount of voice fluctuations. Vocal fluctuation plays a critical role in determining one's persuasiveness and charisma. Increasing voice fluctuation involves varying the pitch (high or low), volume (loud or quiet), tone (resonant or hollow), tempo (fast or slow), or rhythm (fluid or staccato). 

To better understand your own voice fluctuation, try practicing sentences using a voice recorder. Repeat the same sentence multiple times, but with a range of different emotions. Experiment saying it with authority, anger, sorrow, empathy, warmth, and enthusiasm.


&nbsp;


___Echoing:___  
When someone finishes saying something but you want them to continue, try repeating the last 3-5 words they said in the exact same order. By doing so, you encourage them to continue sharing their thoughts and expand on the topic they brought up, allowing them to feel heard and understood.

By repeating their words, you show them that you are engaged in the conversation and interested in what they have to say. 

This technique can be especially useful in situations where you want to encourage the other person to share more information or provide further details.


&nbsp;


___Speaking with Power:___  
The guidelines below will help you broadcast power through your voice:

<dl>
 <dd>
  Speak slowly. Visualize the contrast between a nervous, squeaky teenager speaking at high speed and the slow, emphatic tone of a judge delivering a verdict.
 </dd>
 
 <dd>
  Pause. People who broadcast confidence often pause for a second or two between sentences or even in the middle of a sentence. This conveys the feeling that they’re so confident in their power, they trust that people won’t interrupt.
 </dd>
    
 <dd>
  Drop intonation. You know how a voice rises at the end of a question? Imagine an assertion: a judge saying “This case is closed.” Feel how the intonation of the word “closed” drops. Lowering the intonation of your voice at the end of a sentence broadcasts power. When you want to sound super confident, you can even lower your intonation mid sentence.
 </dd>
    
 <dd>
  Check your breathing. Make sure you’re breathing deeply into your belly and inhale and exhale through your nose rather than your mouth. Breathing through your mouth can make you sound breathless and anxious.
 </dd>
</dl>


&nbsp;


___Apologizing with warmth:___  
Over-apologizing for things that don't require an apology can sometimes make others feel uncomfortable or put them in a difficult position. Try to express gratitude instead of apologizing, as it can still convey empathy and understanding without putting the focus on oneself as the one who caused the issue.

For instance, instead of saying "sorry for taking so long," one could say "thank you for your patience." This not only conveys appreciation but also acknowledges the other person's experience and can help to prevent any tension or discomfort from building up in the conversation. Using this strategy can help individuals who have a tendency to over-apologize feel more confident and less guilty, while also fostering better communication and understanding in interpersonal interactions.

Own up to your mistakes and don’t be defensive, and thank them for pointing out your mistakes.

However, this strategy may not be applicable in situations where a genuine apology is necessary, such as when someone has done something wrong that has caused harm. In those cases, a sincere apology is still necessary to show accountability and responsibility for one's actions.


&nbsp;


___Receiving Compliments:___  
The next time you’re given a compliment, the following steps will help you skillfully handle the moment:
 
1. Stop whatever you are doing.
1. Absorb the compliment, let it show on your face that they’ve had an impact.

Thank them. Saying “Thank you very much” is enough, but you can take it a step further by thanking them for their thoughtfulness or telling them that they’ve made your day.
