# CHAPTER 3: Conversational Charisma

# 1: First Impressions

First impressions are extremely important as they can stay with people for years. While it is very easy to make a good impression, many people seem to have no idea what to say when meeting new people.

___Spark up Conversation:___  
Let me assure you, as long as you project warmth and confidence (power) the content of what you say really doesn't matter. There are generally 2 ways to start a conversation:

You can simply comment on what is happening around you.

Another effective method to start a conversation that communicates warmth and sets up the conversation is to make an observation, there are 5 good observations you can make:

* Their hairstyle: “You have such a cool hairstyle it reminds me of….“
* Their clothing style: “Your style is very unique, it’s very …..”
* Their walk: “You have such a determined walk; it reminds me of ….”
* A unique item: “Those are some bad ass shoes, they make you look like ….”
* Matching items: “I just noticed how your …. matches the color of your ….. and your …..”

Follow this up by open-ended questions like "What's the story behind it?" The word "story" evokes a strong emotional response and sends them straight into storytelling mode.

___Asking Their Name:___  
The next step is to ask for their name.

Like Dale Carnegie said, "A person's name is to them the sweetest sound in any language" their name is more interesting to them than all the other names on earth put together.

Remember that name and call it easily, and you will have paid a subtle but very effective complement.


&nbsp;


___Breaking the Ice:___  
Keeping the conversation going can be achieved by asking open-ended questions such as “What brought you here tonight?” or “Where are you from?”

Remember, it’s all about making them the center of conversation for as long as possible. “Talk to a man about himself, and he will listen for hours,” said Benjamin Disraeli. In fact, when you’re speaking, the one word that should pop up most often in your conversation is not “I” but “you”.


&nbsp;


___Assumptions:___  
Now that you’ve got them opening up, to continue the conversation, Instead of asking them things, try to make an assumption. Here are three types of assumptions you can make: 

* Where they are from: “You seem like you are from …” Or “You don’t seem like you are from ...”
* What they do for hobbies/work: “You seem like you do something creative.”
* What type of person they are: “You seem like you're a very outgoing, life-of-the-party type of person.”

They will go: “What?!? Why’s that.” Or, your guess will be right, and you’ll blow everyone’s minds, you answer by giving a legitimate reason to back up your statement. For example, “you speak in a very formal & articulate manner which reminds me of my doctor.”


&nbsp;


___Interests:___  
The royal road to a person’s heart is to talk about the things he or she treasures most. Focusing on the interests of the other person and asking questions they will enjoy answering. 

Encouraging them to talk about themselves and their achievements is also a surefire way to never run out of things to say. 

In addition to always having a topic of conversation, you'll learn a lot of new knowledge about hobbies and other activities that you probably wouldn't have known otherwise. 

To better connect with people, adjust your choice of words and expressions to better match their interests:

* If they are interested in golf, use a metaphor like "hitting a hole in one." 
* If they enjoy sailing, refer to a catastrophe as a "shipwreck."
* If someone is into tech, use terms like “optimizing” and “efficiency”
* If someone is a movie fan, use film-related metaphors like "cut to the chase"


&nbsp;


___Bounce-back technique:___  
If they start asking about you and you want to refocus the conversation on them, use the bounce back technique. Answer the question with a fact, add a personal note, and redirect the question to them:

<dl>
 <dd>
  Them: “So where are you moving to?”
 </dd>

 <dd>
  You: “To France [fact]. I really love the scenery there [personal note]. What do you think about the scenery in France [redirect]?”
 </dd>
</dl>


&nbsp;


___Ending a Conversation:___  
The final moments of a conversation can also have lasting impact, much like first impressions. To make a graceful exit, it's helpful to offer something of value:
 
* Information: an article, book, or Web site you think might be of use to them
* A connection: someone they ought to meet whom you know and can introduce them to
* Visibility: an organization you belong to, where you could invite them to speak
* Recognition: an award you think they should be nominated for

Providing value will often create a feeling of warmth and goodwill toward you, leaving a positive impression of generosity when you exit the conversation.

According to studies conducted by MIT Media Lab, people tend to remember how it feels to speak with someone rather than the exact words or content used in the conversation. Therefore, It's important to take notice of what emotion your conversation gives off because people will associate you with whatever feelings you give them.
